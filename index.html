								<h4>Looking for internships and co-ops 2021</h4>
								<hr>
								I am a student studying Computer Science and Information Technology/Web Science at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy NY. As a programmer, I have experience as a full-stack developer focusing primarily on back-end work, working with both the MEAN and AMP stack. As a leader, I have worked as both a Project Manager as well as a mentor for inexperienced students entering the field. I am currently looking for internship and co-op opportunities in the Spring and Summer of 2021 to further develop my skills as a software developer and leader.

										I am a member of RPI's Web Technologies Group, a Student Senate Committee creating and maintaining tech applications which aim to serve the students of RPI. Some of the projects we work on include the campus Shuttle Tracker, Senate Survey, and Petitions site. One notable accomplishment this past Spring was setting up a TV display in RPI's Student Union for the Shuttle Tracker to be displayed 24/7. This past summer, I was nominated to become the next chair of WTG, and will work on maintaining and updating all projects under WTG. I will begin development of a revamped Student Government Site this Fall, with notable features including a meeting scheduler, database containing StuGov history, and more. <br>
